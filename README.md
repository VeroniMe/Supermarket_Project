# Supermarket System in C

In this project we will implement a food store management system.
In a food store there are:
1. Registered customers and only they can make purchases
2. Products in stock of certain types
3. Show supermarket details
4. Show shopping cart, products by type
5. Add products and customers
6. Make shopping and pay

Some features in SuperMarket system:
- Sorting the store's customers by various fields (qsort)
- Possibility to search for the customer in the food company's customer array according to the parameter by which they are sorted (bsearch)
- Using linked lists
- Using structures
- Saving data in files - regular and binary
- Pointers to functions
- Possibility to save the food company's data also efficiently in a binary file by bit compression
- Using macros, using a conditional compilation constant
- Variadic functions
